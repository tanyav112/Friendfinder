# Friendfinder Application

##Decription
This is a survey application that functions like a basic dating app. The user will go to a home page and click a button to start a survey. The user is directed to a survey with ten questions. The questions range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Based on the answers, the app will calculate the closest compatibility to known "friends" and display on a modal the name and picture of that friend. From there the user can take the test again.

##Basic Instructions 
To create this application you will need use of Node.js and express and body-parser middleware. A server.js file will be needed to create a server on your computer, as well as installing the express and body-parser nmp's. Two html files will need to be created: one index.html where the app will be loaded to the web and survey.html to contain the survey questions and js logic to get final matches. A friends.js file will be needed to house the array of known friends and two Routes.js files to handle the get and post of data from the front and back end.
